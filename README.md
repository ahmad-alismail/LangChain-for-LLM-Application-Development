# LangChain for LLM Application Development

Jupyter notebooks cover key concepts and examples, and also include my personal notes and explanations on various topics presented in [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/). This course instructed by the creator of LangChain Harrison Chase as well as Andrew Ng.

## Course Content

In this course you will learn and get experience with the following topics:

- **Models, Prompts and Parsers**: calling LLMs, providing prompts and parsing the response
- **Memories for LLMs**: memories to store conversations and manage limited context space
- **Chains**: creating sequences of operations
- **Question Answering over Documents**: apply LLMs to your proprietary data and use case requirements
- **Agents**: explore the powerful emerging development of LLM as reasoning agents.

At the end of the course, you will have a model that can serve as a starting point for your own exploration of diffusion models for your applications.
