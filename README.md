# [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/lesson/1/introduction)

In this course, you will gain essential skills in expanding the use cases and capabilities of language models in application development using the LangChain framework.

## Course Content

In this course you will learn and get experience with the following topics:

- **Models, Prompts and Parsers**: calling LLMs, providing prompts and parsing the response
- **Memories for LLMs**: memories to store conversations and manage limited context space
- **Chains**: creating sequences of operations
- **Question Answering over Documents**: apply LLMs to your proprietary data and use case requirements
- **Agents**: explore the powerful emerging development of LLM as reasoning agents.

At the end of the course, you will have a model that can serve as a starting point for your own exploration of diffusion models for your applications.

## About the Course

This one-hour course, instructed by the creator of LangChain Harrison Chase as well as Andrew Ng, will vastly expand the possibilities for leveraging powerful language models, where you can now create incredibly robust applications in a matter of hours.
