    "# Chains in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an LLM in isolation is fine for some simple applications, but more complex applications require chaining LLMs - either with each other or with other experts. LangChain provides a standard interface for Chains, as well as several common implementations of chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we need chains?\n",
    "Chains allow us to combine multiple components together to create a single, coherent application. For example, we can create a chain that takes user input, formats it with a ``PromptTemplate``, and then passes the formatted response to an LLM. We can build more complex chains by combining multiple chains together, or by combining chains with other components.\n"
