    "# LangChain: [Memory](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/popular/chat_vector_db)\n",
    "By default, Chains and Agents are stateless, meaning that they treat each incoming query independently (as are the underlying LLMs and chat models). In some applications (chatbots being a GREAT example) it is highly important to remember previous interactions, both at a short term but also at a long term level. The Memory does exactly that.\n",
    "\n",
    "``LangChain`` provides several kinds of 'memory' to store and accumulate the conversation. It provides memory components in two forms. \n",
    "* First, LangChain provides helper utilities for managing and manipulating previous chat messages. These are designed to be modular and useful regardless of how they are used. \n",
    "* Secondly, LangChain provides easy ways to incorporate these utilities into chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory can return multiple pieces of information (for example, the most recent N messages and a summary of all previous messages). The returned information can either be a string or a list of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through the simplest form of memory: **“buffer” memory**, which just involves keeping a buffer of all prior messages."
